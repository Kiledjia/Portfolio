    <h1>My Journey.</h1>
      <p>Motivated, passionate, ambitious, and creative are just some of the ways I would describe myself. 
        Growing up as an Armenian-American child I was fascinated with technology and spent most of my time obsessing over the 
        latest products and applications in the tech world. During high school my growing captivation 
        with the complex world of coding and engineering introduced me to the field of Computer Science. 
        After exceling in my high school programming course, I knew Computer Science was the right path for me.
        I attending my local community college as a Computer Science major for two years where I established
        a great foundation in the field. I then transfered to UC Irvine for their incredible school of Information and Computer Science 
        that allowed me to pursue my interest in both Software and Human Computer Interaction as an Informatics major.
        Currently, I am on track to graduate with a degree in Informatics in 2021 with high marks and honors.

    <h1>My Degree.</h1>
      <p class="more">
        My Bachelor's degree is in Informatics from UC Irvine's school of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). 
        Informatics brings together software engineering, human-computer interaction, and the study of 
        information technology in organizations into a single, focused degree program.
        Informatics addresses the design and construction of information technology systems 
        that will be effective in real-world situations. It includes not only building software 
        but also examining the human, organizational, and social context where the system will be used.
        Traditional computer science programs focus on analyzing and designing computers and computer 
        systems, but the success of those systems depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics 
        but also on the real-world situations where they will be usedâ€”the human users 
        and their requirements, characteristics, and organizations. Informatics studies computer systems in 
        their real-world context and how to design and build those systems so they work effectively in that context.

    <h1>In My Free Time.</h1>
      <p class="more">
        When I am not programming or analyzing systems, I enjoy listening to and growing my record collection.
        Los Angeles is home to some of the greatest record shops, and I've got plently to recommend!
        Exploring LA in general is one of my favorite pass time activities, this includes (but is certainly not limited to) 
        long drives down the Pacific Coast Highway, hiking the beautiful Hollywood Hills, and expanding my 
        palate through the city's incredibly cultured food scene.
